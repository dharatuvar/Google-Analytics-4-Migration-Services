 Google Announced the sunset of Universal Analytics property along with the announcement of Google Analytics 4, the next-generation measurement tool.
 According to Google, the GA4 property will completely replace the old Universal Analytics property, which will stop processing new data from July 1, 2023, onwards. The deadline is July 1, 2024, for webmasters using Google Analytics 360 Suite. Webmasters will no longer be able to process new data through the old Universal Analytics. However, they’ll have access to the old data for at least six months.
 
 If you are still using the old Universal Analytics, it is a good time to switch to Google Analytics 4 to start collecting the data at the earliest. Google Analytics 4 is powerful and better at collecting than the classic Universal Analytics (UA).
